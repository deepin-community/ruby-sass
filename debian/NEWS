ruby-sass (3.4.16-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * When using `--stdin` with the `sass` or `scss` executables,
    importing relative to the working directory is deprecated.  Having
    the working directory on the load path was deprecated in 3.3 and
    removed in 3.4, but due to an oversight the deprecation process
    never happened for files read over standard input in particular.
    This is the first step of that process.

ruby-sass (3.3.6-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * 3.3.0 introduced a range of backwards incompatibilities.
    Please read /usr/share/doc/ruby-sass/changelog.gz for the details.

ruby-sass (3.2.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Sass will now print a warning when it encounters a single @import
    statement that tries to import more than one file. For example, if
    you have @import "screen" and both screen.scss and _screen.scss
    exist, a warning will be printed. This will become an error in
    future versions of Sass.
